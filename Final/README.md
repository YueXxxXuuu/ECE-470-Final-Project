# ECE_470_Final_Project
# Final Code

1.	final_code is the main function for the solution to the three level Tower of Hanoi.
	
2.	pick is the helper function to pick up a cylinder.
	
3. 	drop is the helper function to pick up a cylinder.

4. 	The other functions are used to solve the motion planning to move the robot to desired positions.

5. 	We also include the previous checkpoint functions to make the project complete.

6.	Details are explained in the final report.

7.	First Step: Obtain forward kinematic for each way point.

8. 	Second Step: Start Simulation.

9.  Third Step: Does the algorithm to solve the three-level Tower of Hanoi.
